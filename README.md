It's the first "project" I put in github, so I may make some mistakes, like how this README.md was supposed to look like
If you have any comment, don't hesitate to contact me !

The purpose of this (fun !) project was to discover javascript, especially "canvas"

How to use ?
You just have to open "webpage.html" with your favorite web browser !
then, you can choose what cell you want to put in the box, and drag your mouse !


You can easily create new types of cell:
in "test_cell.js", create a new function "createNameOfYourCellCell()"
in "webpage.html", create a new button for your new cell
it's done !

upgrade possible:
Water dynamic: water may take some times to flatten.
Cell on the extremity does not work properly (to avoid out of range error) --> not a good way to do it.
add velocity to cell ? in order to allow explosions.
add pressure to liquide cell ? that may allow interesting simulatio.n, but may take a lot of computational power.
